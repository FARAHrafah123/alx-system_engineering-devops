# Postmortem Report - Database Downtime (January 20, 2024)

## Problem Description

On January 20, 2024, our database experienced an unplanned downtime, lasting for one hour, from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM (UTC+0). The outage impacted critical services relying on the database, resulting in degraded performance and temporary unavailability.

## Timeline

- **3:00 PM:** An abrupt increase in error rates was detected, signaling a potential issue.
- **3:05 PM:** The engineering team was alerted and began investigating the root cause.
- **3:15 PM:** It was identified that the primary database server was unresponsive.
- **3:20 PM:** Attempts to restart the database server were unsuccessful.
- **3:30 PM:** Further investigation revealed a corrupted database index.
- **3:45 PM:** Implemented a database index rebuild to address the corruption.
- **4:00 PM:** Database server was restored, and services resumed normal operation.

## Root Cause and Resolution
