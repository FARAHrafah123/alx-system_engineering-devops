Issues with the Infrastructure:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
Since the entire infrastructure relies on a single server, any failure can cause the entire website to go down.
Hardware failures, software crashes, or other issues could lead to prolonged downtime.
Downtime During Maintenance:
When deploying new code or performing maintenance, the web server needs to be restarted.
This can cause downtime, affecting user access during the maintenance window.
Inability to Scale:
With a single server, it's challenging to handle a significant increase in incoming traffic.
The infrastructure cannot easily scale horizontally to accommodate more users.
